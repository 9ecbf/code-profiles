# Code Profiles

This repository contains all of the customized Visual Studio Code Profiles of mine that I usually use in daily development.

The [Minimal](minimal.code-profile) profile consists of some should-use extensions along with the absolutely-black theme that is, I reckon, the best suit for whom is pursueing the simplicity.
